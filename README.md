# HLT-2
Raquel Lowsley HLT 2 for Software Academy

A two page html exercise in which a user can toggle between a page where they register as a new member or or a page where they log in to their account as an existing member. Both these pages include a form coded within a table structure in which I was able to experiment and learn different types of input options. Beneath the forms there is a table which is duplicated across both pages, within this table is included images and lists.
